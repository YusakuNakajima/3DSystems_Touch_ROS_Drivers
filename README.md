3D Systems Touch ROS Driver
============

ROS Packages for connecting *one* or *more* 3D Systems Touch (previously known as Phantom Touch or Geomagic Touch) haptic devices, **USB** version.
This repository is forked from the [Geomagic_Touch_ROS_Drivers](https://github.com/bharatm11/Geomagic_Touch_ROS_Drivers) repository.


## Environment
- **Confirmed Device**:  
  This package is tested with the **3D Systems Touch HID** haptic device.
  While it has not been specifically tested with the **Touch X**, it is likely to work with it as well.  
- **Supported OS**:  
  This package is tested on **Ubuntu 20.04** and **Ubuntu 22.04**.  

- **ROS Version**:  
  Tested with **ROS Noetic**.  

- **Notes for Ubuntu 22.04**:  
  The package has been tested only in a Docker environment running a **ROS Noetic setup on an Ubuntu 20.04 image**.  


## Install Device Driver and SDK (OpenHaptics)

Run the following command to install the device driver.  
**Driver Version**: `TouchDriver_2024_09_19`  
**Compatibility**: Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04  

> **Note**: Although the official documentation does not explicitly mention support for Ubuntu 20.04, confirmation from 3D Systems indicates that this driver is compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 as well.  

```bash
./install_all.sh
```

You can test the connection of the device by responding to the prompt:  

```bash
./checkup_Touch_device.sh
```

## Launch ROS Nodephantom

After installing the device driver and building the workspace, you can launch the ROS node.
This launch file will start the ROS node and publish the data from the haptic device.
You can read data from the haptic device and write force feedback to the device.
```bash
roslaunch touch_common touch_state.launch
```

Data from the haptic device can be read from the following topics:

  /touch/button
  
  /touch/force_feedback
  
  /touch/joint_states
  
  /touch/pose
  
  /touch/state

With RViz visualization launch is as follows:
```bash
roslaunch touch_common touch.launch
```
